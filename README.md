🏏 IPL Score Prediction



This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) match based on real-time data such as overs, wickets, current run rate, and more.

📌 Project Overview


This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates:


Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model selection and evaluation

Final score prediction using trained models

📂 Files


IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb: Main notebook containing all code from data loading to prediction.

🔧 Technologies Used


Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Features


Predict final score of an ongoing IPL innings

Uses features like:

Batting & Bowling teams

Overs completed

Current score

Wickets fallen

Current run rate

Recent performance (last 5 overs)

⚙️ Models Used


Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor (Best performing)

🧠 Model Performance


The notebook evaluates multiple models using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Visualization of predicted vs actual scores

📌 How to Use

Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file.

Install required libraries (if not already installed):

bash
Copy
Edit

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the notebook step-by-step in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.

✅ Future Improvements


Integrate live match data
